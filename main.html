            <h1>Abstract</h1>

            <p>This project provides code generator for Java that produces class with methods that match i18n properties. Calling
            methods on the generated interface rather that reference string property keys in source code prevents to reference a
            non-existing key.</p>

            <p>For instance, assume that we have two java property files. The fist one, <code>messages.properties</code>, provides english messages
            (the default language in this case) for an application</p>

            <pre class="brush: java">
            hello.world=Hello everybody
            hello.to.somebody=Hello {0} {1}
            </pre>

            <p>And the second one, <code>messages_fr_FR.properties</code>, provides the same messages in french</p>

            <pre class="brush: java">
            hello.world=Bonjour tout le monde
            hello.to.somebody=Bonjour {0} {1}
            </pre>

            <p>The purpose of the plugin is to generate a java interface (and its implementation, as we'll see later) with methods
            that match properties defined in <code>*.properties</code> files. The generated interface looks something like this one</p>

            <pre class="brush: java">
            public interface Messages {

              String hello_world();

              String hello_to_somebody(String arg0, String arg1);

            }
            </pre>

            <p>An implementation class for this interface is generated as well. The goal of this implementation is to return the value
            corresponding to the right language for each interface's method. "The right language" means the one according to either
            the defaut locale or the one given by  a LocaleProvider, an interface that can be implemented to compute the locale on
            the fly at runtime. For example, you would like to get the locale from the user session in case of a web application.</p>

            <pre class="brush: java">
            public class MessagesImpl implements Messages {

              @Override
              public String hello_world() {
                // ...
              }

              @Override
              public String hello_to_somebody(String arg0, String arg1) {
                // ...
              }

              // Some technical stuffs...

            }
            </pre>

            <p>Then, you finally just have to use these generated class in you application like any another. For example,</p>

            <pre class="brush: java">
            Messages messages = ... // Instanciate the MessagesImpl class the way you want. With the new keywork, a Spring lookup, ...
            String helloMe = messages.hello_to_somebody("Guillaume", "Giamarchi");
            </pre>

          </div>
